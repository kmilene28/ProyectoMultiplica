                    <p>Internationally, Romero Britto has exhibited in London, Stockholm, Madrid, Tokyo and Italy. His works are also popular with celebrities or renowned figures, some of which Romero Britto has based portraits on, such as Roger Federer, Dustin Hoffman, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Michael Jordan, Gloria Estefan, Andre Agassi, Eileen Guggenheim, David Rockfeller, and Senator Ted Kennedy. His most recent exhibition held in London was “Modern Icons”, hosted at Imitate Modern Gallery, from 16 November to 7 December 2011. The exhibition featured a series of portraits of the members of the British Royal family. The icons represented included The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, HM Queen Elizabeth II, The Pope, Chairman Mao, Henry Matisse, Brigitte Bardot and Jesus. The portrait of the new British Royal couple was the highlight of the auction, and Britto commented: “It was wonderful to create their portrait, I just adore their love story and what they represent for all of us... love, longevity and history.”</p>

                    <p>Revealed in peaceful, playful, sensual, and perpetually joyful themes, Romero Britto's people, animals, flowers, and sunsets reveal the enthusiastic potential of everyday experiences. "To achieve such airborne emotions, Romero Britto has invented his own pictorial language. With brilliant colors, harmonious shapes, and pleasing patterns, the art of Romero Britto is an art that demands to be taken on its own terms," says Eileen Guggenheim of Britto's art in the Museo de Bellas Artes in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.</p>

                    <p class="formulatext">Romero Britto's daring combinations of color, size, pattern and prospective are quite deliberate. The varied thickness of Britto's black outlines enhance the depth and form of his subjects. The precise stripes and polka dots create textures that further describe the subject matter as three-dimensional characters and places. Most distinctive is Romero Britto's own signature as a design element in each of his canvases since 1992. These elements combine to create a style that is fresh and invigorating and can be understood by all.</p>

                    <p>To Van Gogh this picture was an expression of 'perfect rest', or 'sleep in general'. The bright, cheerful little room has become a field of rapid convergences, sharp angles, and contrasts of high color. The perspective vision of the walls and bed is as exciting as one of his deep landscapes, where we are carried headlong to the horizon. But in such a view with 'a rushing series of lines, furrows rising high on the canvas', Van Gogh found an expression of 'calmness, of great peace.' These surprising reactions permit us to see the spontaneous intensification of movement in his rendering of things. For his high-strung nature, the most relaxed perceptions were already charged and restless. But his feeling of repose in paintings so full of movement is also the outcome of a kind of cathartic process; by projecting movement into nature, he is relieved of tensions and wins a real peace.</p>

                    <p>Starry Night depicts a dreamy interpretation of the artist's asylum room's sweeping view of Saint-Rémy-de-Provence. Though Van Gogh revisited this scene in his work on several occasions, "Starry Night" is the only nocturnal study of the view. Thus, in addition to descriptions evident in the myriad of letters he wrote to his brother, Theo, it offers a rare nighttime glimpse into what the artist saw while in isolation. "Through the iron-barred window I can make out a square of wheat in an enclosure," he wrote in May of 1889, "above which in the morning I see the sunrise in its glory."</p>

                <p>Vincent Willem van Gogh was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who is among the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. In just over a decade he created approximately 2100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of them in the last two years of his life.</p>
